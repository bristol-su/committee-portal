                        We hope you've enjoyed the year as much as we have, we appreciate all the
                        work you have put into running {{$group_name}} this year and wish you the very best of luck for
                        the future. We look forward to working with your new {{strtolower($position_name)}}, {{$forename}} {{$surname}}, but don't forget that you
                        will continue to have access to the portal until your group has fully affiliated.
                    </p>
