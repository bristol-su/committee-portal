                    It's important to keep a register of all equipment owned by your groups so that you can keep track
                    of your assets. It's also something we need to keep on file for financial auditing purposes. This
                    page can be used to declare any equipment you own valued at Â£500 or more (you can declare items
                    worth less if you like, but this isn't a requirement).
