                    <p>Your group's constitution sets out how you plan to operate, and what your members can expect from
                        your committee. Please read over your constitution before you upload it to make sure it is still
                        relevant for your group. If changes need to be made they should be done at a general meeting of
                        your members with at least 2/3rds present. Minor changes such as removal of out of date policy
                        and references to old systems (MSL) can be made without a general meeting. </p>
