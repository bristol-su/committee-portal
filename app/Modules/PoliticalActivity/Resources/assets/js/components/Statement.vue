                <li>Bristol SU encourages students to develop their political awareness, acquire knowledge of and debate
                    political issues through the facilitation of student groups. This is done in a balanced manner and
                    without preference to one or more particular political parties over others.
                </li>

                <li>Neither the Studentsâ€™ Union nor any of its affiliated student groups can make donations to external
                    organisations, this includes political parties.
                </li>

                <li>Funds within your Bristol SU bank account cannot be used directly to support the political party
                    your
                    group represents. E.g. printing literature to canvas general public, fund canvassing trips, etc
                </li>

                <li>Bristol SU will remain neutral and not support or oppose a particular political party, candidate or
                    politician.
