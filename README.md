The Bristol SU Committee Portal allows administrative processes to be executed cleanly and with minimal staff interaction. Currently, the portal is used for reaffiliation of Bristol SU groups, in which the SU collects information about each group to aid in their running in the coming year

## V3.0

Version 3 of the portal, estimated release before December 2019, will allow anyone to create any process in any way. By grouping together a set of modules (such as a 'file upload' module, a 'training' module and a 'committee members' module), you can create an activity for a set of students or groups, and monitor their progress through the activity.

The best bit? Modules can be customised or built to best suit your union, so you can continue doing things the way you currently do, but save hundreds of hours of staff and student time. The portal also integrates with any backend system with an API (such as UnionCloud, MSL, SUMS etc).

If you think the portal may be useful for your union, fill in [this form](https://www.bristolsu.org.uk/portalinterest) and we'll let you know when the portal is released and help you work out how it could be used best in your organization.
